Daily Planner

## Author:

Kat Gorecki

### User Story:

I need a daily planner to keep track of my day's events. Today's date should load when I open the page. Each hour in the planner should be color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, current, or upcoming. I want to be able to enter events in the planner and have them save when I hit the save icon, even after I refresh the page.

### Usage:

- Open the deployment link and a daily planner with today's date will display.
- There are blocks for each hour from 9am - 8pm.
- If the hour has past, the hour will display a light pink. The current hour will display a plum color. If the hour is still upcoming, it will display in bubblegum pink.
- You can enter events in the pink text boxes.
- You can save the event by clicking the dark blue save icon.
- If you refresh the page, the text you saved will still appear.
